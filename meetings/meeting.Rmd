# Take aways from last time

* Feeling good about principles. 

* Today: writing structure and questions.


# Question 1

* Current form: systems theory, math, comp. 

    + No distinction between observed data and dgp like we spoke about last time. If I do:
        
        + Process in the observed data
        
              * Trend, magnitude, periodicity, stationary, growth, change, cointegration, granger causality
        
        + Process in the dgp - math
        
              * difference equations and stochastics
              
        + Process in the dgp - comp
        
              * as is
              * would people argue that the simon model is not a dgp?
              
        + where would equilibrium or feedback loops go?
    
    + As I read the paper this idea was the only thing on my mind...but that is because we discuss it so much. Would it be on others?
              
              
# Question 2

* Examples at end of each section rather than within each principle

# Question 3

* How to beef up each principle section without pointing to examples

# Some thoughts about intro

* Positive emphasis on all of the things we can do

    + Science is not about devising hugely complex descriptions of the world. It is about devising descriptions that illuminate the world and make it comprehensible (life's other secret)
    
* Funness in explaining at different points of emphasis

    + This is an approach I have elsewhere called 'long zoom' history: the attempt to explain historical chnage by simultaneously examining multiple scales of experience -- from the vibrations of sound waves on the eardrum all the way out to mass political movements (six innovations). We wouldn't make this argument -- but a "you can do this stuff from different angles and it can be helpful" argument.
    
* Process is more than mediation.

    + BTW, do we need to discuss mediation?
