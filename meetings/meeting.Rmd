# Take aways from last time

* Feeling good about principles. 

# Today

* Writing structure and questions.


# Question 1

* Need to make a better distinction between describing observed data vs describing dgp?

* Current form: systems theory, math, comp -- no distinction between observed data and dgp. I could do:
        
        + Process in the observed data
        
              * Trend, magnitude, periodicity, stationary, growth, change, cointegration, granger causality
        
        + Process in the dgp - math
        
              * difference equations and stochastics
              
        + Process in the dgp - comp
        
              * as is
              * would people argue that the simon model is not a dgp?
              
        + where would equilibrium or feedback loops go?
    
    + As I read the paper this idea was the only thing on my mind...but that is because we discuss it so much. Would it be on others?
        + Update 09/05: As I read through it with a fresh mind this didn't bug me... 
              
              
# Question 2

* Examples at end of each section rather than within each principle

# Question 3

* How to beef up each principle section without pointing to examples

# Some thoughts about intro

* Need to be more positive?

* "There is a lot more to process than mediation"

    + BTW, do we need to discuss mediation?
