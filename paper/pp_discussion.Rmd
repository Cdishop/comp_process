# Discussion

Having presented the principles and terms like process, longitudinal, and dynamics, we close with our opinion about how the term "process" should be used. In our view, only explanations about the proposed "true" mechanism should be called "process." If a researcher, instead, simply observes and describes manifest behavior like trend or correlates of trend then they are not explaining process -- but it is still a useful study!
