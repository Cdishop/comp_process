## Dynamic Modeling

We have introduced some fundemental concepts for dynamics. Memory, constraints, random walks, equilibrium -- these are core ideas for researchers to grapple with as they consider dynamic phenomenon. When researchers then collect longitudinal data and estimate models (with these ideas in mind) there are a host of challenges that must be considered. In this section we are going to describe stationarity, dynamic panel bias, and ergodicity.

### Stationarity

States and systems have statistical properties, stationarity is about the stability of those properties. Rachel's performance across time is called a time-series -- it is the trajectory of performance for a single unit (Rachel) over time. That trajectory has properties: it has a mean and a variance (and autocorrelation or serial correlation). If the mean is unstable then Rachel's performance either grows or decreases unconditionally over time. If instead the mean is stable, then Rachel's performance across time fluctuates but within the constraints of its memory and bounds on the system. Almost all models used to estimate coefficients in the organizational literature are stationary models that assume the data they are modeling are realizations of a stationary process. That is, they assume that the states and systems they are trying to estimate parameters for have properties at time $t$ that are the same as the properties at time $t + 1$. 

In simple terms, a stationary process has stable properties across time -- data that demonstrate trend, growth, or random walk behavior are (almost certainly) non-stationary. Here is the hard part: two independent time-series will appear related if both are non-stationary (kukljan; braun; granger). That is, if we measure Rachel's performance and it is consistent with a random walk and we also measure rainfall at Rachel's mother's house across the state and it demonstrates increasing trend for the day, even though these two things are completely unrelated we will more than likely find a relationship between them in a regression-based analysis like those presented at the start of this paper. There are many other papers that describe how to test for stationarity (e.g., CITES), all we are trying to do here is convey how important this notion is. Our literature is not paying attention to random walks, we are not checking for memory, or serial correlation, or stationarity; we should be. 

That said, there is a class of models known as cointegration models that can be used to evaluate relationships in a non-stationary system. These are an entirely different animal, but interested readers can see Engle and Granger (1987), Johansen (1991), Phillips (1991), Phillips and Hansen (1990) and Phillips and Loretan (1991).

Finally, keep in mind that stationarity describes statistical properties that result from the underlying dynamics. States may or may not have memory, they may or may not have lag relationships, or reciprocal influence, and may or may not be constrained by their initial conditions. These aspects are the underlying dynamics, and the distributions that they give rise to have properties; stationarity is about those emergent statistical properties. Any system in equilibrium will be stationary, whereas systems that are not in equilibrium will not be stationary. The dynamics lead to distributions and statistical properties, and those statistical properties create challenges for models. 

### Dynamic Panel Bias

Another challenge for dynamic modeling is a congregation of effects known as dynamic panel bias. First, in dynamics we pay attention to memory, and our equations above took the form:

\begin{equation}
y_{t} = a y_{t-1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the only change is that we replaced performance with a generic $y$. The equation above has what is called a "lagged DV," where $y_{t}$ is predicted by the lagged DV: $y_{t-1}$. Including lagged DVs helps us **conceptually** represent dynamics (keele), but including a lagged DV in a **model** applied to data with actual statistical properties causes the errors to correlate with the predictors and ultimately violate the well-known independence of errors assumption. This issue applies even when we are only considering a single unit (like Rachel) across time. 

The second issue arises when we are interested in relationships with a multiple-unit sample across time. Almost all organizational studies are multiple-unit -- they collect data on more than one participant. If the people in the sample are not perfectly exchangeable, which means that I can learn the same thing about performance and fatigue by studying either Bob or Rachel, I lose no information by restricting my analysis to one of them, then the parameter estimates are influenced by what is known as unobserved heterogeneity. Unobserved heterogeneity represents aggregate, stable individual differences. Rachel's fatigue over time may look different from Bob's fatigue over time due to unmeasured individual differences and states. These unacknowledged effects are responsible for individual differences on fatigue so they need to be incorporated in statistical models. We acknowledge them by incoporating unobserved heterogeneity, again it is a term that is meant to represent all of the unmeasured things that make Rachel's trajectory different from Bob's trajectory. 

In dynamic modeling unobserved heterogeneity must be handled appropriately: if is is modeled as independent but in fact correlates with the model predictors then ommitted variables bias is introduced into the estimates, and if unobserved heterogeneity is ignored then serial correlation will be introduced into the errors. 

Dynamic panel bias is the combined effect of these two biases. Lagged DVs help us convey a dynamic process but they create estimation problems, and unobserved heterogeneity must be accounted for. Hierarchical linear models (or random-coefficient, multi level, random effects) do not handle these biases appropriately (CITES). 

### Ergodicity

In the last section we spoke about unobserved heterogeneity, which can be thought of as heterogeneity in individual differences or unit effects. That is, there are unmeasured differences that result in Rachel's trajectory being different from Bob's. An appropriate next question is, when is it reasonable to pool Rachel and Bob? When can we be confident that there is homogeneity of dynamics? *WHAT ELSE*?
