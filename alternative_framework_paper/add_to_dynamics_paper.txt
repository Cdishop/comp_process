Sabine lag relationships and time scales. Redesign may take time to occur. 



Dynamics is not cause. You are still running an observational study. Memory in the DV, reciprocal relationships, equilibrium, but you have no authority to say cause. You can estiamte a model in one direction and then estimate it in the other direction and find significant predictors only going in one way, but you still can't say cause. Cause is a research methods issue. You can explore the dynamics of a phenomenon with an observational study or an experiment or quasi-experiment. Manipulation, random assignment, and assumptions are required for causal inferences. Dynamics can be the focus of the study in the presence or absence of those research methods.
