Think about how common it is to find phrases about dynamics scattered throughout an introduction to an article, phrases like "we are going to address the dynamics," "taking a dynamic perspective," "prior research has not appreciated the dynamics," "we consider the phenomenon as dynamic," or "we examine it on a dynamic basis." What do these mean? How do researchers take a dynamic perspective?

Researchers tend to study and convey their dynamic process of interest with respect to a statistical model or class of models. For example, researchers that are familiar with growth models will talk about the importance of growth in a variable or how within-person trajectories have been ignored in prior research, they will then estimate a growth curve, and ultimately convey something about trends or growth over time and how this has added a new dynamic perspective to our understanding [e.g., @dunford_is_2012; @hulsheger_dawn_2016]. "Growth model thinking," as well as other recent ways of discussing how things happen over time, have produced wonderful insights into important processes in organizational science, and we see them as initial steps toward dynamics. 

When researchers couch their thinking in a model, however, some concepts naturally go unnoticed. We are accumulating tremendous knowledge by collecting longitudinal data, focusing on how things happen over time, and opening the door of dynamics, but there are dynamic principles that have yet to be exposed in our literature -- we have not yet stepped fully through the door. In this paper we discuss a variety of dynamics principles; some are concepts that will reorient how researchers think about dynamics and others are statistical properties that, if ignored, result in biased inferences. Ultimately we are bringing attention to principles that should be incorporated if we are interested in a dynamic perspective.

Below, we first discuss two broad classes of "thinking with respect to a statistical model" that have done the hard work -- they are sets of empirical studies taking initial steps towards dynamics. The first we call "growth," and the second "relationships," and we discuss example studies in each to briefly show our field's interest in dynamics and how researchers approach it. These first two sections are not exhaustive, we are simply sampling the common ways researchers currently think about dynamics to motivate the core of the paper. There, we unpack the dynamic principles.
