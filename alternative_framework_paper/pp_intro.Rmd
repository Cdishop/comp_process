We -- organizational psychologists -- are increasingly interested in dynamics and process phenomena. Longitudinal studies are becoming more prevalent in our literature and the number of time points they employ appears to be growing. The empirical literature uses the terms "dynamics" and "dynamical" at exponentially larger rates in recent years [@deshon_multivariate_2012]. A majority of published methods literature now focuses on longitudinal data analysis [@aguinis_first_2009], and there are a number of great reviews on dynamic models [@Wang2016] and issues of time [@beal_esm_2015; @shipp_time_2015]. Moreover, this interest covers many content areas, including self-regulation, leadership, and team performance [@hardy_interrelationships_2018; @schaubroeck_can_2016].

We have noticed a pattern in how people think about and describe dynamics in empirical studies. Researchers tend to study and convey their dynamic process of interest with respect to a statistical model or class of models. For example, researchers that are familiar with growth models will talk about the importance of growth in a variable or how within-person trajectories have been ignored in prior research, they will then estimate a growth curve, and ultimately convey something about trends or growth over time and how this has added a new dynamic perspective to our understanding. "Growth model thinking," as well as other recent ways of discussing how things happen over time, have produced wonderful insights into important processes in organizational science, and we see them as initial steps toward dynamics. 

When researchers couch their thinking in a model, however, some concepts naturally go unnoticed. We are accumulating tremendous knowledge about our core variables and processes by opening the door of dynamics, but there are even more principles that have yet to be exposed in our literature -- we have not yet stepped fully through the door. In this paper we discuss a variety of dynamics principles; some are concepts that will reorient how researchers think about dynamics, and others are statistical properties that, if ignored, could result in biased inferences. 

Below, we first discuss two broad classes of "thinking with respect to a statistical model" that have done the hard work -- they are sets of empirical studies taking initial steps towards dynamics. The first we call "growth," and the second "relationships," and we discuss example studies in each to briefly show our field's interest in dynamics and how some researchers approach it. These first two sections are not exhaustive, we are simply sampling a few of the common ways researchers currently think about dynamics to motivate the core of the paper. There, we unpack a variety of dynamics principles that must be incorporated as we enter this domain.
