# Stepping Toward Dynamics -- Relationships

Another popular approach to "getting dynamic" is to examine relationships across time rather than trends or covariates of trend.

@rosen_who_2016 explore the relationship between incivility and self-control. They motivate their research by stating that "although examinations of incivility have gained momentum in organizational research, theory and empirical tests involving dynamic, within-person processes associated with this negative interpersonal behavior are limited" (p. 1). They also argue that "previous studies focused almost exclusively on chronic forms of incivility that occur on average during unspecified periods of time, which overlooks the dynamic and temporal nature of incivility and its effects. Consistent with ego depletion theory, we consider a dynamic process that explains why employees become more uncivil." (p. 2). Their participants respond to three surveys a day (morning, afternoon, and evening) for 10 workdays. The morning survey assesses self-control, the afternoon survey assesses self-control, experienced incivlity, and instigated incivility, and the evening survey measures experienced incivility and instigated incivility. They regress afternoon self-control on afternoon incivility and morning self-control. Another model regresses evening incivility on afternoon self-control.

@koopman_integrating_2016 examine the costs and benefits of OCBs on behalf of the actor -- specifically how OCBs relate to positive affect and work goal progress. They motivate their study by stating that they "respond to calls in the literature to examine the consequences of OCB on a more dynamic basis" (p. 415). Their respondents fill out three surveys (morning, afternoon, and evening) for ten workdays. The morning survey assesses OCBs, positive affect, and work goal progress. The afternoon survey measures work goal progress and the evening survey assesses outcome variables irrelevant to the discussion here. They examine the relationship between OCBs and positive affect by regressing afternoon positive affect on morning OCB and morning work goal progress. They examine the relationship between OCBs and work goal progress by regressing afternoon work goal progress on morning OCB and morning work goal progress.
