# Discussion - A Dynamic Perspective

We opened this paper by talking about how researchers are beginning to approach dynamics. We pointed to two frameworks -- growth and relationships -- as example empirical research doing the hard work of getting our thinking beyond static, cross-sectional associations. They were appropriate first steps toward dynamics given our field's history with random coefficient models and recent introduction to growth curve modeling, but there are many dynamic principles outside the context of a specific longitudinal model -- we broached them here. Taking a dynamic perspective means focusing on memory, constraints, timescales, reciprocal influence, initial conditions, and exploring an array of satistical properties like serial correlation and stationarity. Taking a dynamic perspective means being seriously concerned that your trajectory is not simply a random walk or white noise process.

We are going to close this paper with three short, unique sections to solidify the principles and what we mean by a dynamic perspective. In the first section we highlight recent dynamic studies that explore some of the principles discussed here. Then, we consider what dynamics is not. We conclude by presenting the linear dynamic systems model as the fundamental framework for dynamic investigations. 

## Recent Work

There are a variety of great studies already exploring some of the key dynamic properties. To get a sense for this literature and to highlight the principles that they capture we searched for empirical studies that were (1) published in the last five years (2) in the **Journal of Management**, **Journal of Applied Psychology**, or **Academy of Management Journal** and (3) contained "dynamic" or "dynamics" in the title. We exclude research that is cross-sectional, ethnographic, or focuses only on growth/covariates of growth. The articles and the dynamic notions that they emphasize are listed in table one. 

Every study emphasizes lags -- they evaluate associations, influence, and patterns from current states to subsequent states, or prior states to current states. For example, @hardy examine the relationship between self-efficacy and subsequent exploratory behavior (and they examine lag effects across all of their variables). @jones study the relationship between revealing behaviors among pregnant women and subsequent physical health symptoms. Many also discuss serial correlation, autocorrelation, or autoregression. @gabriel assess autocorrelations ranging from T-1 to T-20 seconds, and their table one demonstrates how autocorrelation coefficients decrease in size over longer lags (i.e., emotions show stronger self-similarity when they are related to $t-1$ emotions versus $t-20$ emotions). Autocorrelation and seral correlation, however, are always discussed with respect to statistical models. That is, authors are not making arguments about memory, self-similarity, or constraints in their explanations, but focusing on autocorrelation because the models they use incorporate it. Finally, a number of studies explore reciprocal patterns over time and a few discuss unobserved heterogeneity indirectly by using a statistical test to determine if they should employ a fixed or random effects model (i.e., a Hausman test). These are recent, exciting dynamic perspectives that our literature is beginning to expose. 

Notice, however, that we also included an "opportunities" column that highlights the principles not discussed in each article. Although researchers are thinking about lags and autocorrelation, there are other principles like random walks, equilibrium, stationarity, endogeneity, timescales, and initial conditions that have yet to be explored and are great opportunities for researchers to discover even more dynamics. Many of the principles we draw attention to do not require any further data, they are points to consider to (a) deter inferential errors and (b) learn more about the system -- they do not require cumbersome new data collection, just a different point of view. We hope this paper will ignite more study into the principles we described. 

## What Dynamics Is Not

It is often helpful to consider what something is not to fully grasp its content. In this section we present a few notions that do not constitute dynamics.

#### Time as a predictor is not dynamics.

Time as a moderator.

Static equations versus dynamic equations. Equation 1 equation 2. They are similar, but they represent vastly different worlds. One explores instantaneous relationships with no constraints; essentially a congregation of cross-sectional slices. The other is interested in the flow across time. Exploring relationships over time is useful, but it is not dynamics.

#### Dynamics is not synonymous with growth.

#### Relationships across time is not dynamics.
