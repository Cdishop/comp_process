# Discussion - A Dynamic Perspective

We opened this paper by briefly discussing how researchers in applied psychology are beginning to approach dynamics. We pointed to two frameworks -- growth and relationships -- as examples of empirical research doing the hard work of getting our thinking beyond static, cross-sectional associations. They were appropriate first steps toward dynamics given our field's history with random coefficient models and more recent emphasis on growth curve modeling, but there are many dynamic principles outside the context of a specific longitudinal model -- we presented them here. Taking a dynamic perspective means focusing on memory, constraints, timescales, reciprocal influence, initial conditions, and exploring an array of statistical properties like serial correlation and stationarity. Taking a dynamic perspective means being seriously concerned that your trajectory is not simply a random walk or white noise process.

We close this paper with two short, unique sections to solidify the principles and what we mean by a dynamic perspective. In the first section we consider what dynamics is not, and we conclude by presenting the linear dynamic systems model as the fundamental framework for dynamic investigations. The linear dynamic systems model embodies the fundamental concepts discussed in this paper. 

## What Dynamics Is Not

During a time when authors were discussing what constitues theory, @sutton1995theory produced a useful article describing what theory is not -- it is a conerstone reading for management, organizational behavior, human resources, and organizational psychology programs across the country. A similar approach may be useful here, where addressing what dynamics is not could help researchers fully grasp its content. 

### Time as a predictor is not dynamics.

Our field has a number of great papers discussing the idea that time cannot be causal. Ployhart and colleagues have probably said it best: "constructs do not change, evolve, or develop because of time; rather they do so over time. For example, time does not cause children to grow into adults. Even though time is highly related to physical growth, the causes of growth are genetics and environment" [@ployhart_longitudinal_2010, p. 98]. Moreover, our theories do not specify time as a causal variable but instead specify that changes happen over time due to other causes [@pitariu_explaining_2010].

We agree with these statements but extend them slightly to encompass a dynamic perspective. Imagine a study that evokes time as a moderator and then makes a conclusion such as, "early on A happens, whereas later on B happens." They do not discuss time as the cause, but they do argue that they are studying dynamics because state behaviors differ at time 3 compared to time 2. Identifying that time 3 states and relationship patterns are different from those at time 2 is useful, but it is not dynamics, it is not characterizing how past behavior constrains new state patterns or how states from one moment reach others at subsequent moments. In concrete terms, finding that job satisfaction is high for newcomers and low for old-timers is not dynamics, neither is recognizing that it positively relates to performance during week one but negatively relates to performance after a month on the job. Dynamics is studying how job satisfaction unfolds through time based on its constraints, self-similarity, initial conditions, and reciprocal sources of influence. 

@voelkle_relating_2015 and @serang_correspondence_2018 make a similar distinction in their discussions of the difference between static and dynamic statistical models. Static models employ time as a predictor, meaning that time is treated explicitly in the model. Dynamic models, conversely, treat scores at a given time as a function of scores at previous times such that time enters the model implicitly through the order of measurement occasions. 

### Static relationships across time are not dynamics.

Longitudinal data do not automatically make the focus of a study dynamics. Many studies that collect longitudinal data do not examine dynamics but instead assess static relationships across time. Consider two simple (mock) examples of studies on burnout and job satisfaction. 

The first study collects self reports of burnout and job satisfaction everyday for three weeks. The researchers regress burnout at time $t$ on satisfaction on time $t$ and report the relationship. Their analysis, therefore, considers the following relationship:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Satisfaction}_{t} = a * \textrm{Burnout}_{t} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where satisfaction at time 1 is related to burnout at time 1, satisfaction at time 2 is related to burnout at time 2, and so on.

Now consider a slight change. The researchers instead examine self-similarity in satisfaction and a lag effect from burnout. That is:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Satisfaction}_{t} = a * \textrm{Satisfaction}_{t - 1} + b * \textrm{Burnout}_{t - 1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where satisfaction at time 5 is related to its prior self and burnout at time 4, satisfaction at time 6 is related to satisfaction and burnout at time 5, and so on. 

The only difference between the aforementioned studies is that one acknowledges memory and lags whereas the other does not, but those aspects represent and imply fundamentally different things about the world. The first (equation 15) considers the world as a sequence of cross-sectional slices, a perspective that @ilgen_computational_2000 call "multiple snapshots," where static associations are compiled across time. It also implies that any state behaviors or relationships among the states follow a seemingly odd sequence: relationships happen at one moment and then are wiped out and replaced by completely new behavior and relationship patterns at the next. Finally, it represents a world where burnout instantaneously causes satisfaction.

The second, dynamic perspective (equation 16) represents a much different structure. Satisfaction is constrained by where it was in the past and therefore it cannot bounce to extreme levels without first moving from its prior state. Moreover, the effect from burnout takes time to occur and aligns with intuitive and theoretical notions of causality. Finally, the patterns between satisfaction and burnout will ultimately drive toward equilibrium. A study of relationships over time is useful, but it is not dynamics.

### Dynamics is not synonymous with growth.

A dynamic phenomenon does not have to grow or exhibit increasing/decreasing trend. The underlying dynamics may or may not produce trend, but growth is not a fundamental concept in dynamics. Similarly, observing growth or correlates of growth in an empirical study is not dynamics. It is useful and we hope researchers continue to explore growth patterns in their content areas, but a study that "unpacks dynamics" is much different from a study that estimates trend and predictors of trend. 

## Conclusion - The Linear Dynamic Systems Model

Much of the historical research in our field emphasized bivariate, cross-sectional relationships that are embodied in the general linear model. As we incorporate dynamics, there are a number of additional principles to consider and we discussed many of them in this paper. The principles of dynamics are all represented in a different fundamental model: the linear dynamic systems model[^1]. Just as the general linear model subsumes historical research focused on static relationships, the linear dynamic systems model will embody our upcoming dynamic investigations. In its simplest form, the linear dynamic sytems model is:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{x}_t = \textbf{A} \textbf{x}_{t-1} + \textbf{b}
\end{equation}

\noindent where **x**$_t$ is a vector of states at time $t$. The vector is similar to the state vector we presented in the concepts section (depletion, fatigue, burnout), but here we use a generic term to capture any state or set of states of interest. The equation also captures the states at the prior time point, **x**$_{t-1}$, and those states are multiplied by **A**, a matrix of transition weights. The transition weights capture memory, constraints, lags, and reciprocal influence within the system -- the diagonal elements represent self-similarity and the off-diagonal elements are cross-state influence. **b** is a vector of constant values (time-invariant) that are commonly referred to as forcing terms. Although they do not receive a term in the equation, initial conditions are also inherent to the linear dynamic systems model because specifying or identifying a trajectory requires starting values. The principles described in this paper are embodied in the linear dynamic systems model and it will serve as the underlying framework as we enter the exciting domain of dynamics. 

[^1]: A full statistical model contains an equation explaining the data and assumptions on the errors. We present the linear dynamic systems "model" not as a fully specified statistical model but as a framework that embodies the dynamic concepts presented in this paper. It is a mathematical tool that conveys the dynamic principles and can be translated into a statistical model with ease.
