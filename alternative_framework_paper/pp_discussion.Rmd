# Discussion - A Dynamic Perspective

We opened this paper by talking about how researchers are beginning to approach dynamics. We pointed to two frameworks -- growth and relationships -- as example empirical research doing the hard work of getting our thinking beyond static, cross-sectional relationships. They were appropriate first steps toward dynamics given our field's history with random coefficient models and recent introduction to growth curve modeling, but there are many principles of dynamics outside the context of a specific longitudinal model -- we broached them here. Taking a dynamic perspective means focusing on memory, constraints, timescales, reciprocal influence, initial conditions, and exploring an array of satistical properties like serial correlation and stationarity. 

## Recent Perspectives



## What Dynamics Is Not

Time as a moderator.

Static equations versus dynamic equations. Equation 1 equation 2. They are similar, but they represent vastly different worlds. One explores instantaneous relationships with no constraints; essentially a congregation of cross-sectional slices. The other is interested in the flow across time. Exploring relationships over time is useful, but it is not dynamics.
