\maketitle

Think about how common it is to find phrases about dynamics scattered
throughout an introduction to an article, phrases like \enquote{we are
going to address the dynamics,} \enquote{taking a dynamic perspective,}
\enquote{prior research has not appreciated the dynamics,} \enquote{we
consider the phenomenon as dynamic,} or \enquote{we examine it on a
dynamic basis.} What do these mean? How do researchers take a dynamic
perspective?

We have noticed a pattern in how people think about and describe
dynamics in empirical studies. Researchers tend to study and convey
their dynamic process of interest with respect to a statistical model or
class of models. For example, researchers that are familiar with growth
models will talk about the importance of growth in a variable or how
within-person trajectories have been ignored in prior research, they
will then estimate a growth curve, and ultimately convey something about
trends or growth over time and how this has added a new dynamic
perspective to our understanding. \enquote{Growth model thinking,} as
well as other recent ways of discussing how things happen over time,
have produced wonderful insights into important processes in
organizational science, and we see them as initial steps toward
dynamics.

When researchers couch their thinking in a model, however, some concepts
naturally go unnoticed. We are accumulating tremendous knowledge by
collecting longitudinal data, focusing on how things happen over time,
and opening the door of dynamics, but there are dynamic principles that
have yet to be exposed in our literature -- we have not yet stepped
fully through the door. In this paper we discuss a variety of dynamics
principles; some are concepts that will reorient how researchers think
about dynamics, and others are statistical properties that, if ignored,
result in biased inferences. Ultimately we are bringing attention to
principles that should be incorporated if we are truly interested in a
dynamic perspective.

Below, we first discuss two broad classes of \enquote{thinking with
respect to a statistical model} that have done the hard work -- they are
sets of empirical studies taking initial steps towards dynamics. The
first we call \enquote{growth,} and the second \enquote{relationships,}
and we discuss example studies in each to briefly show our field's
interest in dynamics and how some researchers approach it. These first
two sections are not exhaustive, we are simply sampling a few of the
common ways researchers currently think about dynamics to motivate the
core of the paper. There, we unpack the dynamic principles.

\hypertarget{stepping-toward-dynamics-growth}{%
\section{Stepping Toward Dynamics --
Growth}\label{stepping-toward-dynamics-growth}}

One of the first steps our field is taking toward appreciating dynamics
is by examining whether something goes up or down over time -- examining
trend or \enquote{growth} patterns.

HÃ¼lsheger (2016) explores fatigue trends. He motivates his study by
stating that his examination of the \enquote{the continuous ebb and flow
of fatigue over the course of the day and about the factors that
influence this temporal ebb and flow} responds to calls to
\enquote{empirically address the dynamic process of recovery and thereby
helps refine recovery theory} (p.~906). For 5 consecutive workdays he
assesses fatigue with self-report surveys -- one in the morning, another
at the first work break, a third at the end of work, and the last in the
evening -- among a sample of Dutch employees. All surveys measure
fatigue, and the morning survey also assessses sleep quality whereas the
fourth measures psychological detachment. He estimates fatigue growth
curves and correlates sleep quality and psychological detachment with
both the fatigue intercept and slope, respectively.

Dunford, Shipp, Boss, Angermeier, and Boss (2012) examine burnout
trajectories over two years. They motivate their study by stating that,
\enquote{theoretically, much of the burnout literature suggests that
burnout should be progressive and dynamic, yet most empirical research
has focused on explaining and testing the antecedents of static levels
of burnout,} therefore \enquote{knowing for whom burnout changes and
when this pattern of change occurs leads to a more realistic view of the
dynamism of human experience and better managerial prescriptions for
addressing burnout} (p.~637). Over two years they assess healthcare
workers with five measurements, each separated by six months. All
surveys measure burnout (all dimensions), and the researchers also
collect between person assessments of job transitions (a categorical
variable indicating whether an employee is a newcomer, recently
underwent an internal job change, or remained at the same position
throughout). They estimate a sequence of growth curves and examine
linear and quadratic slope terms for all three burnout dimensions. They
also covary job transition type with the intercept and slope terms.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

These authors are clearly interested in dynamics, and in this framework
they examine within-person trajectories, whether those trajectories
exhibit trends (growth), and correlate other variables with those
trends.

\hypertarget{stepping-toward-dynamics-relationships}{%
\section{Stepping Toward Dynamics --
Relationships}\label{stepping-toward-dynamics-relationships}}

Another popular approach to \enquote{getting dynamic} is to examine
relationships across time rather than trends or covariates of trend.

Gabriel, Koopman, Rosen, and Johnson (2018) study the association among
helping acts, depletion, and self-serving political acts. They motivate
their study by highlighting the limitations of between-person research
and then state that \enquote{a more appropriate empirical test of this
process requires an intraindividual lens that allows researchers to
consider how OCBs, resources, and subsequent behaviors vary daily. That
is, not assessing the dynamic relations between helping behaviors and
related constructs potentially misaligns the theoretical underpinnings
of the construct and the level of analysis used to assess their
relationships (i.e., taking dynamic processes and assessing them with
static, \enquote{in general} assessments of constructs; Klein \&
Kozlowski, 2000)} (p.~2). For ten work days they collect surveys twice a
day (morning and afternoon). Both the morning and afternoon surveys
assess helping acts, depletion, and political acts. They regress
afternoon depletion on afternoon helping acts and morning depletion, and
they regress afternoon political acts on afternoon depletion and morning
political acts.

Johnson, Lanaj, and Barnes (2014) study relationships between justice
behaviors, depletion, and OCBs -- they argue that exhibiting procedural
justice behaviors is depleting and can negatively influence OCBs. They
motivate their study by stating that our current justice knowledge comes
from \enquote{cross-sectional studies examining between-person
differences,} but \enquote{there is a need for longitudinal, daily
investigations of justice experiences that take a dynamic person-centric
view} (p.~1). Ultimately they argue that their research design enabled
them to \enquote{examine dynamic, within-person effects} and test a
model \enquote{via a more granular approach to time} (p.~11). Their
participants responded to surveys twice a day for 10 working days
(morning and afternoon). The morning survey measured sleep quantity,
whereas the afternoon survey measured justice behaviors, depletion, and
OCBs. They regress afternoon depletion on the morning sleep quantity,
the prior day's afternoon justice behavior, and the prior day's
afternoon depletion.

Rosen, Koopman, Gabriel, and Johnson (2016) explore the relationship
between incivility and self-control. They motivate their research by
stating that \enquote{although examinations of incivility have gained
momentum in organizational research, theory and empirical tests
involving dynamic, within-person processes associated with this negative
interpersonal behavior are limited} (p.~1). They also argue that
\enquote{previous studies focused almost exclusively on chronic forms of
incivility that occur on average during unspecified periods of time,
which overlooks the dynamic and temporal nature of incivility and its
effects. Consistent with ego depletion theory, we consider a dynamic
process that explains why employees become more uncivil.} (p.~2). Their
participants respond to three surveys a day (morning, afternoon, and
evening) for 10 workdays. The morning survey assesses self-control, the
afternoon survey assesses self-control, experienced incivlity, and
instigated incivility, and the evening survey measures experienced
incivility and instigated incivility. They regress afternoon
self-control on afternoon incivility and morning self-control. Another
model regresses evening incivility on afternoon self-control.

Koopman, Lanaj, and Scott (2016) examine the costs and benefits of OCBs
on behalf of the actor -- specifically how OCBs relate to positive
affect and work goal progress. They motivate their study by stating that
they \enquote{respond to calls in the literature to examine the
consequences of OCB on a more dynamic basis} (p.~415). Their respondents
fill out three surveys (morning, afternoon, and evening) for ten
workdays. The morning survey assesses OCBs, positive affect, and work
goal progress. The afternoon survey measures work goal progress, and the
evening survey assesses outcome variables irrelevant to the discussion
here. They examine the relationship between OCBs and positive affect by
regressing afternoon positive affect on morning OCB and morning work
goal progress. They examine the relationship between OCBs and work goal
progress by regressing afternoon work goal progress on morning OCB and
morning work goal progress.

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\subsection{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

These authors are also interested in dynamics. All test for
within-person variance and motivate their studies by stating that
\enquote{the good stuff} resides in the within-person relationships.
They examine concurrent or lagged relationships across their variables
over time, and they are able to collect many observations due to their
frequent sampling.

\hypertarget{opening-the-door-to-dynamics}{%
\section{Opening the Door to
Dynamics}\label{opening-the-door-to-dynamics}}

Both frameworks above get things moving toward dynamics. They consider
great notions like within-person trajectories, patterns over time, and
lag relationships, and they are clearly exploring domains where prior
research was limited. What we want to do is expose researchers to
principles outside of the toolkit they are currently familiar with,
outside of frameworks that are couched in statistical models like growth
curves and relationship patterns with random coefficient models. There
are a host of dynamic principles to cover. Some are concepts, ways of
thinking that are necessary to appreciate as researchers and theorists
explore dynamic phenomona. Others are statistical properties that arise
when researchers apply models to longitudinal data structures -- they
are statistical issues that produce inferential errors if left
unchecked, and they are important across all types of longitudinal
models.

\hypertarget{dynamics}{%
\section{Dynamics}\label{dynamics}}

Dynamics refers to a specific branch of mathematics/mechanics, but the
term is used in different ways throughout our literature. It is used
informally to mean \enquote{change}, \enquote{fluctuating,}
\enquote{volatile,} \enquote{longitudinal,} or \enquote{over time}
(among others), whereas formal definitions in our literature are
presented within certain contexts. Wang (2016) defines a dynamic
\emph{model} as a \enquote{representation of a system that evolves over
time. In particular it describes how the system evolves from a given
state at time \emph{t} to another state at time \(t + 1\) as governed by
the transition rules and potential external inputs} (p.~242). Vancouver,
Wang, and Li (2018) state that dynamic \emph{variables} \enquote{behave
as if they have memory; that is, their value at any one time depends
somewhat on their previous value} (p.~604). Finally, Monge (1990)
suggests that in dynamic \emph{analyses}, \enquote{it is essential to
know how variables depend upon their own past history} (p.~409).

The crucial notion to take from dynamics, then, is memory. When the past
matters, and future states are constrained by where they were at prior
points in time, dynamics are at play. Below, we unpack a number of
important principles couched in this simple idea.

\hypertarget{concepts-and-conventions}{%
\subsection{Concepts and Conventions}\label{concepts-and-conventions}}

These first principles are concepts -- ways of thinking.

\hypertarget{states}{%
\subsubsection{States}\label{states}}

In organizational science we typically use the term \enquote{variable}
to describe a measured construct, and our lens is usually across people.
Burnout, depletion, fatigue, OCBs, performance, job satisfaction --
these are all variables; they are quantities with values that fluctuate
across people. When we instead focus on how values fluctuate across time
we call them \enquote{states.} Performance as a variable, therefore,
focuses on the set of values across people, whereas performance as a
state focuses on its values across time.

The convention to label states is to use what is called a state vector.
A state vector for depletion, fatigue, and performance would be:
\((depletion, fatigue, burnout)\) and its mathematical equivalent is,
\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\) or \((x_1 ...x_n)\). We will use this notation later
after introducing more concepts.

\hypertarget{memory-and-self-similarity}{%
\subsubsection{Memory and
Self-similarity}\label{memory-and-self-similarity}}

Arguably the most fundamental concept in dynamics is that states often
have memory -- they are self-similar across time. Performance may vary
or fluctuate over time, but it retains self-similarity from one moment
to the next. Job satisfaction now is some function of what it was just
prior to now. My conscientiousness tomorrow will have carry over from
what it was today, as will the number of people I communicate with.
Researchers of course may argue that some states have no memory, but the
point here is that states tend to retain something about what they are
from moment to moment.

\hypertarget{constraints}{%
\subsubsection{Constraints}\label{constraints}}

When a state has memory or self-similarity it can still fluctuate or
change over time -- to say that Rachel's job satisfaction will predict
itself over time does not mean that we expect her job satisfaction to be
identical every day. Instead, it will fluctuate or vary but under the
constraints of where it was in the past. Imagine we argue that job
satisfaction has no memory. If we grant that statement, then Rachel's
job satisfaction from moment to moment is unconstrained and it can swing
(potentially) to positive or negative infinity based the states that
cause it. But if it does have memory then it is constrained, it cannot
swing explosively. When she experiences something negative at work --
like ridicule -- her job satisfaction will certainly decrease in the
moment, but what is her job satisfaction decreasing from? The answer is
its prior level -- the negative experience is pushing against her prior
level of job satisfaction, job satisfaction is not created from scratch
just after ridicule. States vary over time, but where they go is
constrained by their history.

It is also helpful to consider what would happen if we vary the strength
of Rachel's job satisfaction memory. First imagine that her job
satisfaction is only weakly self-similar. Now when she experiences
ridicule we would expect her job satisfaction to fluctuate to a large
extent, whereas when her job satisfaction is self-similar we would
expect the fluctuation to be smaller.

\hypertarget{lags}{%
\subsubsection{Lags}\label{lags}}

Memory is not limited to a single variable. Job satisfaction may also be
influenced by the prior history of other states, like depletion or
fatigue. Imagine that we believe that fatigue has a lag effect on
performance. This means that we expect some amount of time to pass
before fatigue influences performance. Said another way, the influence
of fatigue on performance does not happen immediately. Despite
collecting longitudinal data many researchers still examine concurrent
relationships by regressing DVs on IVs at the same moment. That is, they
regress performance at time four on fatigue at time four and performance
at time six on fatigue at time six, despite having the possibility to
explore lag effects. What these concurrent models imply is that the
researcher expects fatigue to instantaneously influence performance.
With some states immediate cause makes sense, but as our \enquote{over
time} thinking progresses there will be many opportunities to explore
lags.

\hypertarget{reciprocal-influence}{%
\subsubsection{Reciprocal Influence}\label{reciprocal-influence}}

Many research questions can be boiled down to trying to find antecedents
and outcomes, but when we focus on dynamics and start thinking about
memory, constraints, and lags across multiple states we focus less on
\enquote{true causes} or antecendents and more on reciprocal influence.
This kind of thinking often takes the form, \enquote{and then this
happens.} Consider the (example) reciprocal relationships between
performance, superior support, and fatigue. I performed my assignment
well so my boss sent me a nice email letting me know that she
appreciated my work. I subsequently increased my performance and again
performed well on my second assignment. Having increased my performance,
however, I am now more fatigued and on my third assignment I perform
poorly. After performing poorly I do not receive the congratulatory
email. In this simple example, performance, fatigue, and superior
support fluctuate across time. We are not necessarily interested in
finding the \enquote{true} cause, direction of effects, or the exact
coefficient between one state and another, but we are interested in the
pattern of reciprocal relationships across time.

\hypertarget{time-scales}{%
\subsubsection{Time Scales}\label{time-scales}}

Researchers can gain valuable insights by considering the timescales of
dynamics. Consider the temperature of a building and each of its
interior rooms. The quick dynamics occur from room to room. Air
molecules pass between them until they are all roughly the same
temperature. But the weather outside also influences the temperature of
the building as a whole -- it just takes longer to occur. When the sun
comes up it does not immediately change the room-to-room dynamics. The
room to room dynamic influences have short lags, whereas the influence
of the outside temperature on any specific room has a much longer lag.

\hypertarget{boundary-space}{%
\subsubsection{Boundary Space}\label{boundary-space}}

When researchers estimate a growth curve and argue for a positive linear
trend what they are implying is that the trajectory increases forever.
Job satisfaction continually increases; OCBs go down forever. In dynamic
systems with reciprocal influence and constraints there are boundaries
on where processes can go. Communication may fluctuate day to day, and
it may even increase steadily as an employee transitions into a new
role, but it is unlikely that it will continue to increase or decrease
without bound forever.

\hypertarget{initial-conditions}{%
\subsubsection{Initial Conditions}\label{initial-conditions}}

The last concept is that initial conditions may or may not influence the
overall dynamics. Imagine an employee's climate perceptions fluctuating
over time, and showing a reciprocal pattern with a number of other
important states. The dynamics of his climate perceptions may depend on
his first encounters with the company -- his initial perceptions.
Perhaps his initial perceptions were positive and over time showed
reciprocal patterns with performance, dyadic social exchanges, burnout,
and leadership perceptions. A researcher paying attention to initial
conditions would examine if those same reciprocal patterns emerge under
different starting conditions, like a bad first encounter.

An example is in Liebovitch, Vallacher, and Michaels (2010) explanation
and model of conflict and cooperation between two actors. Their
explanation takes into account several states for a two-person
situation, including (1) each individual's general affective state, (2)
feedback from one person to the other, and (3) each individual's general
tendency to change based on the feedback. They argue that the patterns
of conflict and cooperation that two individuals demonstrate over time
differ dramatically if both individuals start with the same affective
tone (positive and positive or negative and negative) versus opposing
tones -- that is, the dynamics of conflict and cooperation are sensitive
to the initial conditions of the actors involved.

\hypertarget{describing-trajectories}{%
\subsubsection{Describing Trajectories}\label{describing-trajectories}}

In this paper we are introducing concepts and statistical properties
that merit attention as we approach dynamics. We want to close this
section by pointing readers to a wonderful paper by Monge (1990) that
provides basic vocabularly for describing trajectories. He discusses
terms like trend, periodicity, and cycles -- lexicon for patterns over
time rather than key concepts that are emphasized here. We feel that his
paper should be required reading for anyone interested in dynamics.

\hypertarget{mathematics-and-statistics}{%
\subsection{Mathematics and
Statistics}\label{mathematics-and-statistics}}

We are now going to translate some of the concepts into math. Doing so
will (a) reiterate the principles above, (b) introduce new dynamic
principles, and (c) make it easier to talk about some of the more
complicated statistical properties of dynamic modeling that we turn to
in the final section.

\hypertarget{basic-concepts-in-equations}{%
\subsubsection{Basic Concepts In
Equations}\label{basic-concepts-in-equations}}

Remember that in dynamics we are focused on memory, self-similarity, and
constraints as states move across time. What we are going to do here is
begin to capture those ideas with equations using performance as an
example. First, consider performance across time:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = \textrm{Performance}_{t-1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where performance at time \(t\) is exactly identical to what
it was at \(t-1\). This equation says that performance does not
fluctuate, change, move, or grow across time -- there is zero trend.
Performance is, say, four at time one, four at time two, four at time
three, and so on. This type of equation is called a difference equation,
and it is a foundational tool in dynamics.

Although this first equation seems disceptively simple, we have already
captured memory. Performance in this case is perfectly self-similar.
What if, instead, performance is similar but not perfectly self-similar
across time? To capture this idea we need a new term:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = a \textrm{Performance}_{t-1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(a\) is the extent to which performance is self-similar
and all other terms are defined above. \(a\) is a coeffient relating
performance now to performance at the next moment, and when you estimate
that term in a statistical model it is called an autoregressive term.
When the autoregressive term is large performance is highly
self-similar, whereas when \(a\) is close to zero performance has less
self-similarity. Two other statistical terms for self-similarity you may
come across include autocorrelation and serial correlation -- both refer
to the correlation a state has with itself over time.

\hypertarget{fundamental-autoregressive-behaviors}{%
\subsubsection{Fundamental Autoregressive
Behaviors}\label{fundamental-autoregressive-behaviors}}

There are fundamental behaviors of dynamic states based on their
autoregressive terms, and these are shown in figure \ref{dynamics_plot}.
The top row of figure \ref{dynamics_plot} shows the trajectory of states
with autoregressive terms that are greater than one in absolute value.
These large terms produce explosive behavior -- exponential growth when
\(a\) is positive and extreme oscillations when \(a\) is negative. When
the autoregressive term falls between zero and one in absolute value,
conversely, the state converges to equilibrium -- shown in the bottom
two panels. Either the state oscillates at a decreasing rate until it
reaches equilibrium (when \(a\) is negative) or it converges there
smoothly (when \(a\) is positive). Again, these behaviors hold for all
states with the given autoregressive terms.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

\hypertarget{equilibrium}{%
\subsubsection{Equilibrium}\label{equilibrium}}

Notice that we introduced a new term in our description above:
equilibrium. Equilibrium describes the state of a variable that no
longer changes unless disturbed by an outside force. It can also be used
to describe multiple variable systems -- where equilibrium again means
that the state remains constant unless disturbed by an outside force,
but here state refers to the the entire system (i.e., all of the
variables). In \emph{static} equilibriums, the system has reached a
point of stability with no change, whereas \emph{dynamic} equilibrium
refers to systems with changes and fluctuations but no net change. That
is, the variables fluctuate across time in periodic ways but the general
state of the system does not diverge so as to change the behavior of the
entire system.

Predator-prey relationships are a typical example of a system in dynamic
equilibrium. For example, consider a predator-prey relationship between
bobcats and rabbits. As the rabbit population increases, the amount of
available food for the bobcats goes up. Over time, this raises the
population of the bobcats as well. Now with a greater bobcat population,
the rabbit population decreases because more are being killed. Over
time, this reduction in food opportunity decreases the bobcat
population. This back and forth oscillating pattern between states
describes a dynamic equilibrium. The states change and there may be
random disturbances to the system across time, but the net dynamics of
the system remain stable -- and therefore this situation is still called
\enquote{equilibrium.}

\hypertarget{stochastics}{%
\subsubsection{Stochastics}\label{stochastics}}

Our route so far has been deterministic -- the mathematical
representations do not contain error. When we want to convey a process
with error we can consider a host of additional principles. Stochastics,
stated simply, refers to processes with error. Consider our simple
difference equation from above, adding an error component produces:

\begin{equation}
\label{diffE}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = a \textrm{Performance}_{t-1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where all terms are defined above but \(e_{t}\) represents an
error term that is incorporated into performance at each time point.
Errors cause performance to be higher or lower at specific points in
time than we would have expected given a deterministic process. For
example, at time \(t\) the error might push performance to a higher
value, and at \(t+1\) to a lower value. Errors are therefore said to be
random because we cannot predict their value at any specific \(t\). In
aggregation (i.e., averaged across time), however, positive errors
cancel negative errors, and large errors are less likely than small
errors. Any time we have an accumulation of random error we get a normal
distribution (McElreath, 2016). In stochastic systems, therefore, the
errors are said to be distributed \(N(0, 1)\) -- that is, random and
unpredictable at any specific \(t\) but distributed with certain
constraints across time.

It can also be helpful to think about what error is not. Anything that
is systematic, predictable, or common (using those in layman's terms)
cannot be error -- leaving error to be the random \enquote{left overs.}
An aggregation of randomness is a normal distribution.

\hypertarget{white-noise-and-random-walks}{%
\subsubsection{White Noise and Random
Walks}\label{white-noise-and-random-walks}}

There are two fundamental stochastic processes: white noise and random
walks. White noise is a process that only has error. Setting \(a\) to
zero in equation \ref{diffE} produces a white noise process.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{whitenoise}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} &= a \textrm{Performance}_{t-1} + e_{t} \\
a &= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, all we have is error over time. The lower panel of
figure \ref{noise} shows the behavior of a white noise process over
time. Random walks are similar, but \(a\) is now equal to one.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{rw}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} &= a \textrm{Performance}_{t-1} + e_{t} \\ 
a &= 1 \\ 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent This representation is also an error process, but there is
performance self-similarity across time. The upper panel of figure
\ref{noise} presents a random walk. Although random walks can sometimes
appear to be moving in a systematic direction, ultimately their behavior
is unpreditable: they could go up or down at any moment.

Random walks and white noise are error processes over time. White noise
processes fluctuate randomly, whereas random walks fluctuate randomly
while retaining some self-similarity through time. These two principles
are the null hypotheses of time-series analysis in econometrics -- where
the first task in a longitudinal study is to demonstrate that you are
investigating something that is not a random walk or white noise. That
is, if a researcher wanted to show the effect of IVs on performance
across time they would first need to demonstrate that performance and
all of their IVs are not random walks or white noise processes. This
step is currently absent in our literature but, again, is the essential
starting place in econometrics.

\hypertarget{dynamic-systems}{%
\subsubsection{Dynamic Systems}\label{dynamic-systems}}

Up to this point we have focused on a single state, performance.
Remember that in dynamics we are also interested in reciprocal
influence, but before moving to two or more state equations we want to
pause and highlight how much researchers can explore with single states.
It is of course interesting and fun to ask how two or more states are
related, or posit a complex sequence among a set of states. But
understanding whether or not one state exhibits white noise or random
walk behavior across time is a valuable study in itself. We feel that
our field could substantially benefit from spending more time plotting
and analyzing the individual trajctories of every measured variable in a
study.

With multivariate systems we need multiple equations -- one for each
state. Before, we demonstrated a simple difference equation for
performance. In a multivariate system with two states, performance and
effort, we need one equation for each.

\begin{equation}
\label{sysy}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = a \textrm{Performance}_{t - 1} + e_{t}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\label{sysx}
\textrm{Effort}_{t} = a \textrm{Effort}_{t - 1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, both equations posit that their state is a function of
its prior self to the extent of the autoregressive term (\(a\)). Notice
that there are no cross-relationships, we are simply representing a
system with two independent variables across time. It is of course also
possible to introduce relationships among the different states with more
terms.

First, consider a system where effort concurrently causes performance.
Another way to say this is that effort\(_t\) causes performance\(_t\):

\begin{equation}
\label{sysy2}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = a \textrm{Performance}_{t - 1} + b \textrm{Effort}_{t} + e_{t}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\label{sysx2}
\textrm{Effort}_{t} = a \textrm{Effort}_{t - 1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where all terms are defined above but now the equation for
performance also includes Effort\(_t\) -- which is the value of effort
at time \(t\) -- and \(b\), the coefficient relating effort to
performance. This set of equations says that effort is simply a product
of itself over time (with error), whereas performance is a function of
itself and also effort at the immediate time point.

What if effort causes performance after some lag? That is, perhaps we
posit that effort does not immediately cause performance but instead
causes performance after some period of time. If the lag effect were 2,
that would mean that Effort\(_t\) causes Performance\(_{t+2}\), and to
express the \enquote{lag 2 effect} mathematically we would use the
following:

\begin{equation}
\label{sysy3}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = a \textrm{Performance}_{t - 1} + b \textrm{Effort}_{t - 2} + e_{t}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\label{sysx3}
\textrm{Effort}_{t} = a \textrm{Effort}_{t - 1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, all terms are nearly identical to what we saw above but
now there is a lag-two effect from effort to performance. Performance is
now a function of both its immediately prior self and the value of
effort from two time points ago.

What if we want to convey feedback, or a reciprocal relationship between
effort and performance? That is, now we posit that both effort causes
performance and performance causes effort. To do so we update our
equations with a simple change:

\begin{equation}
\label{sysy3}
\textrm{Performance}_{t} = a \textrm{Performance}_{t - 1} + b \textrm{Effort}_{t - 2} + e_{t}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
\label{sysx3}
\textrm{Effort}_{t} = a \textrm{Effort}_{t - 1} + b \textrm{Performance}_{t - 2} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where all terms are defined above but now effort and
performance are reciprocally related. Both are determined by themselves
at the immediately prior time point and the other state two time points
in the past. Effort happens, and two moments later this influences
performance, and two moments later this goes back to influence effort,
and so on throughout time. All the while, both states retain
self-similarity -- they fluctuate and develop but only under the
constraints afforded by the autoregressive terms.

We can make the equations more complicated by continuing to add
variables or longer/shorter lag effects, but the beauty of math is its
freedom to capture whatever the researcher desires. These equations are
language tools to help researchers convey a process over time.

\hypertarget{dynamic-modeling}{%
\subsection{Dynamic Modeling}\label{dynamic-modeling}}

We have introduced some fundemental concepts for dynamics. Memory,
constraints, initial conditions, equilibrium, reciprocal influence --
these elements constitute the underlying dynamics and are ingredients to
grapple with as researchers consider dynamic phenomenon. Dynamic
mechanisms give rise to observed data, distributions, and statistical
properties for us to witness, and it is those observed data that we
apply models to. In a perfect world researchers could put a magnifying
glass up to their observed data and its statistical properties and
clearly identify the underlying dynamics. Unfortunately we do not live
in that world. Instead, there are a host of challenges that must be
considered when researchers collect longitudinal data and estimate
models to make inferences about dynamics. In this section we are going
to describe stationarity, dynamic panel bias, and ergodicity.

\hypertarget{stationarity}{%
\subsubsection{Stationarity}\label{stationarity}}

States and systems have statistical properties, stationarity is about
the stability of those properties. Rachel's performance across time is
called a time-series -- it is the trajectory of performance for a single
unit (Rachel) over time. That trajectory has properties: it has a mean
and a variance (and autocorrelation or serial correlation). If the mean
is unstable then Rachel's performance either grows or decreases
unconditionally over time. If instead the mean is stable, then Rachel's
performance across time fluctuates but within the constraints of its
memory and bounds on the system. Almost all models used to estimate
coefficients in the organizational literature are stationary models that
assume the data they are modeling are realizations of a stationary
process. That is, they assume that the states and systems they are
trying to estimate parameters for have properties at time \(t\) that are
the same as the properties at time \(t + 1\).

In simple terms, a stationary process has stable properties across time
-- data that demonstrate trend, growth, or random walk behavior are
(almost certainly) non-stationary. Here is the hard part: two
independent time-series will appear related if both are non-stationary
(kukljan; braun; granger). That is, if we measure Rachel's performance
and it is consistent with a random walk and we also measure rainfall at
Rachel's mother's house across the state and it demonstrates increasing
trend for the day, even though these two things are completely unrelated
we will more than likely find a relationship between them in a
regression-based analysis like those presented at the start of this
paper. There are many other papers that describe how to test for
stationarity (e.g., CITES), all we are trying to do here is convey how
important this notion is. Our literature is not paying attention to
random walks, we are not checking for memory, or serial correlation, or
stationarity; we should be.

That said, there is a class of models known as cointegration models that
can be used to evaluate relationships in a non-stationary system. These
are an entirely different animal and they require a deep understanding
of mathematics and econometric modeling, but interested readers can see
Engle and Granger (1987), Johansen (1991), Phillips (1991), Phillips and
Hansen (1990) and Phillips and Loretan (1991).

Again, keep in mind that stationarity describes statistical properties
that result from the underlying dynamics. States may or may not have
memory, they may or may not have lag relationships, or reciprocal
influence, and may or may not be constrained by their initial
conditions. These aspects are the underlying dynamics, and the
distributions that they give rise to have properties; stationarity is
about those emergent statistical properties. Any system in equilibrium
will be stationary, whereas unstable systems will be non-stationarity.
The dynamics lead to distributions and statistical properties, and those
statistical properties create challenges for models.

\hypertarget{dynamic-panel-bias}{%
\subsubsection{Dynamic Panel Bias}\label{dynamic-panel-bias}}

Another challenge for dynamic modeling is a congregation of effects
known as dynamic panel bias. First, in dynamics we pay attention to
memory, and our equations above took the form:

\begin{equation}
y_{t} = a y_{t-1} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the only change is that we replaced performance with a
generic \(y\). The equation above has what is called a \enquote{lagged
DV,} where \(y_{t}\) is predicted by the lagged DV: \(y_{t-1}\).
Including lagged DVs helps us \emph{conceptually} represent dynamics
(keele), but including a lagged DV in a \emph{model} applied to data
with actual statistical properties causes the errors to correlate with
the predictors and ultimately violate the well-known independence of
errors assumption. This issue applies even when we are only considering
a single unit (like Rachel) across time.

The second issue arises when we are interested in relationships with a
multiple-unit sample across time. Almost all organizational studies are
multiple-unit -- they collect data on more than one participant. If the
people in the sample are not perfectly exchangeable, which means that I
can learn the same thing about performance and fatigue by studying
either Bob or Rachel, I lose no information by restricting my analysis
to one of them, then the parameter estimates are influenced by what is
known as unobserved heterogeneity. Unobserved heterogeneity represents
aggregate, stable individual differences. Rachel's fatigue over time may
look different from Bob's fatigue over time due to unmeasured individual
differences and states. These unacknowledged effects are responsible for
individual differences on fatigue so they need to be incorporated in
statistical models. We acknowledge them by incoporating unobserved
heterogeneity, again it is a term that is meant to represent all of the
unmeasured things that make Rachel's trajectory different from Bob's
trajectory.

In dynamic modeling unobserved heterogeneity must be handled
appropriately: if it is modeled as independent but in fact correlates
with the model predictors then ommitted variables bias is introduced
into the estimates, and if unobserved heterogeneity is ignored then
serial correlation will be introduced into the errors.

Dynamic panel bias is the combined effect of these two biases. Lagged
DVs help us convey a dynamic process but they create estimation
problems, and unobserved heterogeneity must be accounted for.
Unfortunately the current workhorse in our literature to examine dynamic
phenomena (the hierarchical linear, random-coefficient, or multi level
model) is not well suited to handle dynamic panel bias. See Xu and
DeShon (current) for a greater discussion of the issue and a recommended
model.

\hypertarget{ergodicity}{%
\subsubsection{Ergodicity}\label{ergodicity}}

In the last section we spoke about unobserved heterogeneity, which can
be thought of as heterogeneity in individual differences or unit
effects. That is, there are unmeasured differences that result in
Rachel's trajectory being different from Bob's. An appropriate next
question is, when is it reasonable to pool Rachel and Bob's data? When
can we be confident that there is homogeneity of dynamics? This is the
notion of ergodicity.

\emph{One more paragraph about it. HELP.}

\hypertarget{discussion---a-dynamic-perspective}{%
\section{Discussion - A Dynamic
Perspective}\label{discussion---a-dynamic-perspective}}

We opened this paper by discussing how researchers are beginning to
approach dynamics. We pointed to two frameworks -- growth and
relationships -- as example empirical research doing the hard work of
getting our thinking beyond static, cross-sectional associations. They
were appropriate first steps toward dynamics given our field's history
with random coefficient models and recent introduction to growth curve
modeling, but there are many dynamic principles outside the context of a
specific longitudinal model -- we broached them here. Taking a dynamic
perspective means focusing on memory, constraints, timescales,
reciprocal influence, initial conditions, and exploring an array of
satistical properties like serial correlation and stationarity. Taking a
dynamic perspective means being seriously concerned that your trajectory
is not simply a random walk or white noise process.

We are going to close this paper with three short, unique sections to
solidify the principles and what we mean by a dynamic perspective. In
the first section we highlight recent dynamic studies that explore some
of the principles discussed here. Then, we consider what dynamics is
not. We conclude by presenting the linear dynamic systems model as the
fundamental framework for dynamic investigations.

\hypertarget{recent-work}{%
\subsection{Recent Work}\label{recent-work}}

There are a variety of great studies already exploring some of the key
dynamic properties. To get a sense for this literature and to highlight
the principles that they capture we searched for empirical studies that
were (1) published in the last five years (2) in the \emph{Journal of
Management}, \emph{Journal of Applied Psychology}, or \emph{Academy of
Management Journal} and (3) contained \enquote{dynamic} or
\enquote{dynamics} in the title. We exclude research that is
cross-sectional, ethnographic, or focuses only on growth/covariates of
growth. The articles and the dynamic notions that they emphasize are
listed in table one.

The studies as a whole explore a number of dynamic principles. First,
every study emphasizes lags -- they evaluate associations, influence,
and patterns from current states to subsequent states, or prior states
to current states. For example, ({\textbf{???}}) examine the
relationship between self-efficacy and subsequent exploratory behavior,
the relationship between prior exploratory behavior and subsequent
metacognition, and the relationship between self-efficacy and subsequent
exploratory behavior (among others). ({\textbf{???}}) study the
relationship between revealing behaviors among pregnant women and
subsequent physical health symptoms. Many also discuss serial
correlation, autocorrelation, or autoregression. ({\textbf{???}}) assess
autocorrelations ranging from T-1 to T-20 seconds, and their table one
demonstrates how autocorrelation coefficients for emotion decrease in
size over longer lags (i.e., emotions show stronger self-similarity when
they are related to \(t-1\) emotions versus \(t-20\) emotions). Finally,
a number of studies explore reciprocal patterns over time and a few
discuss unobserved heterogeneity indirectly by using a statistical test
to determine if they should employ a fixed or random effects model
(i.e., a Hausman test). These are recent, exciting dynamic perspectives
that our literature is beginning to expose.

Notice, however, that we also included an \enquote{opportunities} column
that highlights the principles not discussed in each article. Although
researchers are thinking about lags and autocorrelation, there are other
principles like initial conditions, equilibrium, timescales, random
walks, stationarity, and endogeneity that have yet to be explored and
are great opportunities to discover even more dynamics. We also noticed
that many of the studies that assess autocorrelation do not have
conceptual discussions about memory or self-similarity or constraints,
but instead assess autocorrelation as a statistical hurdle to overcome
before discussing the lag relationship of interest. It is certainly
appropriate to assess -- especially to avoid inferential errors -- but
we would like to reiterate that finding evidence of memory in a state is
useful knowledge on its own and helps build theoretical understanding.

Finally, many of the principles that we highlight as opportunities do
not require grueling extra work. Rather, they are simple points to
consider to (a) deter inferential errors and (b) learn more about the
system without requiring any new cumbersome data collection, just a
different point of view. We hope this paper will ignite more study into
the principles we described.

\hypertarget{what-dynamics-is-not}{%
\subsection{What Dynamics Is Not}\label{what-dynamics-is-not}}

During a time when authors were discussing what constitues theory,
Stutton and Staw (1995) produced a useful article describing what theory
is not -- and this paper is a cornerstone for management and
organizational psychology programs across the country. A similar
approach may be useful here, where addressing what dynamics is not could
help researchers fully grasp its content. In this section we consider
several notions that do not constitute dynamics.

\hypertarget{time-as-a-predictor-is-not-dynamics.}{%
\subsubsection{Time as a predictor is not
dynamics.}\label{time-as-a-predictor-is-not-dynamics.}}

Our field has a number of great papers discussing the idea that time
cannot be causal. Ployhart and colleagues have probably said it best:
\enquote{constructs do not change, evolve, or develop because of time;
rather they do so over time. For example, time does not cause children
to grow into adults. Even though time is highly related to physical
growth, the causes of growth are genetics and environment.} (P V,
p.~98). Moreover, our theories do not specify time as a causal variable
but instead specify that changes will happen over time due to other
causes (p P).

We agree with these statements but want to extend them slightly to
encompass a dynamic perspective. Imagine a study that evokes time as a
moderator and then makes a conclusion like, \enquote{early on A happens,
whereas later on B happens.} They do not discuss time as the cause, but
they do state that they are studying dynamics because they identified
change and a volatile state. We want to emphasize that such a study is
not exploring dynamics. Identifying that states or relationships are
different at one moment compared to another is useful, but it is not
dynamics, it is not characterizing how those states or relationships
unfold through time, or how states from one moment reach others at
subsequent moments. In concrete terms, finding that job satisfaction is
high for newcomers and low for old-timers is not dynamics, but studying
how job satisfaction unfolds through time based on its self-similarity,
initial conditions, and reciprocal sources of influence is.

\hypertarget{static-relationships-across-time-are-not-dynamics.}{%
\subsubsection{Static relationships across time are not
dynamics.}\label{static-relationships-across-time-are-not-dynamics.}}

Longitudinal data do not automatically make the focus of a study
dynamics. Many studies that collect longitudinal data examine static
relationships across time rather than dynamics, and to see this consider
two simple (mock) examples of studies on burnout and job satisfaction.

The first study collects self reports of burnout and job satisfaction
everyday for three weeks. The researchers regress burnout at time \(t\)
on satisfaction on time \(t\) and report the relationship. Their
analysis, therefore, considers the following relationship:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Satisfaction}_{t} = a \textrm{Burnout}_{t} + e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where satisfaction at time 1 is related to burnout at time 1,
satisfaction at time 2 is related to burnout at time 2, and so on.

Now consider a slight change. The researchers instead examine
self-similarity in satisfaction and a lag effect from burnout. That is:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{Satisfaction}_{t} = a \textrm{Satisfaction}_{t - 1} + b \textrm{Burnout}_{t - 1} e_{t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where satisfaction at time 5 is related to its prior self and
burnout at time 4, satisfaction at time 6 is related to satisfaction and
burnout at time 5, and so on.

The only difference between the aforementioned studies is that one
acknowledges memory and lags whereas the other does not, but those
aspects represent and imply fundamentally different things about the
world. The first considers the world as a sequence of cross-sectional
slices, a perspective that Hulin and Ilgen call \enquote{multiple
snapshots,} where static associations are compiled across time. It also
implies that any state behaviors or relationships among the states
follow a seemingly odd sequence: relationships happen at one moment and
then are wiped out and replaced by completely new behavior and
relationship patterns at the next. Finally, it represents a world where
burnout instantaneously causes satisfaction.

The second, dynamic perspective represents a fundamentally different
structure. Satisfaction is constrained by where it was in the past. It
cannot bounce to extreme levels without first moving from its prior
state. Moreover, the effect from burnout takes time to occur and aligns
with intuitive and theoretical notions of causality. Finally, the
patterns between satisfaction and burnout will ultimately drive toward
equilibrium over time. A study of relationship patterns over time is
useful, but it does not represent dynamics.

\hypertarget{dynamics-is-not-synonymous-with-growth.}{%
\subsubsection{Dynamics is not synonymous with
growth.}\label{dynamics-is-not-synonymous-with-growth.}}

A dynamic phenomenon does not have to grow or exhibit
increasing/decreasing trend. The underlying dynamics may or may not
produce trend, but when researchers state that a phenomenon is dynamic
that does not mean that it grows. Dynamics is about the fundamental
properties described in this paper, growth is not one of them.
Similarly, observing growth or correlates of growth in an empirical
study is not dynamics. It is useful and we hope researchers continue to
explore growth patterns in their content areas, but a study that
\enquote{unpacks dynamics} is much different from a study that estimates
trend and predictors of trend.

\hypertarget{the-linear-dynamic-systems-model}{%
\subsection{The Linear Dynamic Systems
Model}\label{the-linear-dynamic-systems-model}}

Much of the historical research in our field studied cross-sectional
relationships, and the principles of this view are embodied in the
general linear model. As we incorporate dynamics there are a number of
additional principles to consider, and we discussed them in this paper.
The principles of dynamics are all represented in a different
fundamental model: the linear dynamic systems model. Just as historical
research was subsumed in the general linear model, the linear dynamic
systems model will embody our upcoming dynamic investigations. In its
simplest form, the linear dynamic sytems model is:

\begin{equation}
\textbf{y}_t = \textbf{A} \textbf{y}_{t-1} + \textbf{b}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \textbackslash{}textbf\{y\_t\} is a vector of states at
time \(t\). The vector is just like the state vector we presented in the
concepts section (depletion, fatigue, burnout), but we are using a
generic term to capture any state of interest. The equation also
captures the states at the prior time point \(t-1\), and those states
are multiplied by \textbf{A}, a matrix of transition weights. The
transition weights capture memory, constraints, lags, and reciprocal
influence within the system -- the diagonal elements represent
self-similarity and the off-diagonal elements are cross-state influence.
\textbf{b} is a vector of constant values (time-invariant) that are
commonly referred to as forcing terms. Finally, recognize that the
linear dynamic systems model is an abstraction, to specify or identify
particular trajectories it is necessary to provide the initial
condititions of the system.

The linear dynamic systems model embodies the core principles and will
be the underlying model in upcoming dynamic investigations. The
principles discussed in this paper should give researchers a new
perspective on how to approach this exciting domain.
