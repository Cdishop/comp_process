Dynamics, dynamic in the title

Excluded ethnography

Excluded when people use the term "dynamics" to mean a changing environment rather than a "dynamic process."

Excluded cross-sectional studies

Mentioned at least one of the concepts we discussed here. So, we excluded studies that just examined growth or just relationships (in a manner similar to those studies outlined at the beginning of the paper).

Looked at but excluded:
Grand et al., 2016 JAP - computational model
Da Motta Veiga et al., 2016 JAP - put time as a moderator. Really just a growth curve.
Kaltianinen et al., 2017 JAP - just relationships across time
Farh Chen 2018 JAP - Kind of longitudinal but they use "phases"
Ferris et al., 2018 JAP - not longitudinal
