## Computational Specifics -- Things I need to know to make a process comp model

### Key States

### State Dynamics

### Constants

### Actions

### Action selection

### Context/Environment

### Noise

### Time Scale

# Paper break

In other words, you need to give me all of the equations and what they represent. But asking everyone to either a) comp model or b) represent their process with equations seems like a big burden. We certainly want to get there, but there must be another way for people to help. How so? By exploring some emergent process behavior that would result had I known the equations. 

If I had the specifics above, I would get emergent process behavior. We think there is merit to studying this emergent behavior as a way of working backwards. You may not be able to give me the equations, but pay attention to some of the concepts that we unpack. What is listed below are terms that we use to describe this emergent behavior. Terms from systems theory and dynamics, and terms from the statistical modeling literature. 

## Systems Theory and Dynamics terms

### Equilibrium

### Cycles and Oscillations

### Feedback Loops

You can tell me that the process has feedback loops. But that doesn't tell me how to specify them. If you had given me the equations, feedback loops would or would not result. 

### Periodicity (Monge)

### Trend (Monge)

### Duration (Monge)

### Magnitude (Monge)

## Statistical and Mathematical Terms

### Autoregression

### Stationarity

You can tell me that the variables are stationary. But that doesn't tell me what their means are over time. If you had given me the equations, stationary would or would not result. 

### Random Walks

### Cointegration

### Diffusion 

### Damping

### Markov Process

# Conclusion

It's really hard to specify the functional form of relationships. Here are some concepts to explore that help us work backwards.
