Repository for the book chapter, *Principles For Taking a Dynamic Perspective* by Christopher R. Dishop, Jeffrey Olenick, and Richard P. DeShon. The final pdf is located in this top folder, whereas the Rmarkdown files used to generate it are located within the "alternative framework paper" folder. The other folders contain notes and writing that are relevant to the many different ways of writing the paper that we considered.
