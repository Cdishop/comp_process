Many organizational phenomena can be viewed as combinations of stocks and flows. Stocks: Affect [@sonnentag], helping behaviors, depletion, number of customers, justice perceptions, work-family conflict. Flows: turnover, stressful events, goal assignments. Sometimes the same thing can be expressed as both a stock and a flow, depending on how the researcher abstracts the situation. For example, the number of work tasks could be a stock, where it increases when we are given more assignments and decreases when we finish them. Or it could be a flow that leads into something like stress.
